# Producing events

This section describes how to use `emit` to produce diagnostics in your applications. That includes:

- [Logging events](./producing-events/logging.md).
- [Tracing operations](./producing-events/tracing.md).
- [Sampling metrics](./producing-events/metrics.md).
- [Quick debugging](./producing-events/quick-debugging.md).

`emit`'s macros all use the same syntax for describing events. You can read more about that in [Template syntax and rendering](./reference/templates.md).
